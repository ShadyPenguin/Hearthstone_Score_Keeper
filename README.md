### Tired of storing your deck-data in a LAME excel doc or Google drive?
Have no fear, HSK is here! Don't let the fun end once your game ends; updating, storing, and viewing your data should be just as entertaining.

## Objective
1) Have fun coding for something I love

2) Create an app that is 100% TDD

3) Host a space for Hearthstone players to store their deck data in an interactive, fun way

4) Add media queries to improve UX
